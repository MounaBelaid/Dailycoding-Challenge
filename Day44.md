## Day 44 of #dailycoding challenge ‚¨áÔ∏è

Today we are interested in #RStudio #addins.

RStudio addins were released in early 2016 to provide anyone with the ability to add #extensions to RStudio.

An Rstudio addin is installed as a package, and it simplifies some manipulations.

Through out this post, we are particularly interested in the #beautifyR addin.

beautifyR is a RStudio addin that can help to format Markdown tables. It aligns the columns according to the content width, adds missing columns if needed and inserts the formatting row if missing.

Additionally the Beautify Comment addin allows for aligning multi-line comments. This saves a lot of time when editing vast commentary in code.

To understand more the functionnality of the beautifyR addin, take a look at the short video below ‚¨áÔ∏è

A list of RStudio addins are available at this link üëâ https://lnkd.in/ditcJgr
