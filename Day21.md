## Day 21 of #dailycoding challenge ⬇️

Today we are interested in #t-test. t-test is the common used test in statistics to determine whether the means of two groups are equal to each other.

The assumption for the test is that both groups are sampled from normal distributions with equal variances. The null hypothesis is that the two means are equal, and the alternative is that they are not. It is known that under the null hypothesis, we can calculate a t-statistic that will follow a
t-distribution with n1 + n2 - 2 degrees of freedom.

* The function #t.test is available in R for performing t-tests.
* names() is used to determine the names of the parameters.
* To extract it, we can use the dollar sign notation, or double square brackets.

Take a look at the examples below to understand more the use of the t.test function ⬇️
